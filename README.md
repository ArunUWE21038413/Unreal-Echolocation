# Unreal-Echolocation
Advanced Tech Portfolio Project-1

A prototype shader effect made using Unreal's material editor and blueprint logic. Replicates a ripple/pulse effect on dark surfaces and makes those regions visible for a short period of time. Visible spots can be identified thru their white outlines over the edges of an object/environment.

An evidence video link has been posted here to demonstrate its working and how it could potentially be a game mechanic for games that use sound to navigate their environment.

Instructions:-
1) Open Unreal
2) Click the Start icon to run the game
3) You can start observing ripples to spread on the ground as you make any movements. Also after equipping the projectile gun, each shot creates a ripple on contact with any surface. Effect disappears in a few seconds.
